A dashboard to view financial information using the MERN stack.  

## Description
My first project outside of the confines of the Bootcamp program.  This project is to develop a financial dashboard using the MERN stack and showcase the creation of common dashboard information for various users and industries without having to pay a high price for tools like Tableau, Alteryx or Power BI.  The application will hopfully feature [Syncfusion](https://www.syncfusion.com/) as the primary front-end toolset with React. The expected project completion date is February 2024.  Please check back for updates on our progress.
